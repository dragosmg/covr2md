> Test Coverage Summary on 'GitHub'

On a GitHub pull request, {covr2gh} runs {covr}'s `package_coverage()` on both the current (head) and target (base) branches. It compares the two outputs, prepares a summary and posts it as a comment. The author and reviewer can then take action.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {covr2gh} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

## Usage

You use it in a package. It comes with a helper function that generates a GitHub action workflow.

```r
covr2gh::use_covr2gh_action()
```
