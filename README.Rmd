{covr2gh} was born from a need to have test coverage information to hand when reviewing a pull request.

Due to constraints in enterprise environments, this often needs to be accomplished without depending on a 3rd party vendor, or an [un-verified](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/create-and-publish-actions/publish-in-github-marketplace#about-badges-in-github-marketplace) / unvetted GitHub Action.

The core functionality focuses on extracting coverage data (with `covr::package_coverage()`) and on presenting a brief summary as a comment on a GitHub pull request (PR).


## Installation

You can install the development version of covr2gh from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

## Example

The package is designed to be used with GitHub Actions. It has an accompanying workflow that does the following:

* runs `covr::package_coverage()` on both the head and base branches.
* compares the outputs and prepares a comment, made up of:
    * two high-level summary sentences (one focused on the overall text coverage, the other focused on the diff coverage)
    * a collapsible "Details" section containing two tables which offer more insight into the high-level summaries.
* produces a coverage badge for the head branch and pushes it to a "storage" branch (`_covr2gh_storage`)^[This is not possible for PRs originating from forks as they will not have write permissions to the repo. In this case the produced badge is not self-contained and an external - to the repo - ULR is used instead of committing the badge to the storage branch.].
