> Test Coverage Summary on 'GitHub'

On a GitHub pull request, {covr2gh} runs {covr}'s `package_coverage()` on both the current (head) and target (base) branches. It then compares the two and summarises the findings in a comment.

{covr2gh} does not offer anything new, it's how it offers it. An R package + a GitHub Action workflow that uses only "official" GitHub Actions or [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).

## Installation

You can install the development version of covr2gh from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

Most users would not need to  you would use the package via the accompanying GitHub Action workflow.
