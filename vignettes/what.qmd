When the workflow runs, {covr2gh} posts a comment on the pull request summarising the impact of merging the proposed changes on test coverage.

The comment is made up of two parts:

1. A short summary.
2. A collapsible *Details* section with additional information.


## Summary

Two sentences summarise the impact on test coverage, answering questions often raised during code review.

The first sentence indicates whether merging the pull request will change the overall test coverage.

The second sentence focuses on the changes introduced by the pull request, indicating whether the newly added or modified lines are covered by tests.

The summary is always visible so reviewers can quickly factor coverage changes into their review.

## Details

The *Details* section appears in a collapsible block and provides additional context for the summary, in the form of two tables.

The first table reports files with changes in coverage.

The second table reports coverage for lines added or modified by the pull request.
![](../man/figures/comment_line_cov_details.png){fig-alt="A screen capture showing the second table - focused on diff coverage (coverage of lines added or modified) - from the Details section."}

These tables allow reviewers to inspect coverage changes in a bit more depth should they need to. This information is hidden by default to avoid cluttering the pull request discussion.

Empty tables are not rendered. If both tables are empty, the entire *Details* section is automatically suppressed.
