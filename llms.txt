> Test Coverage Summary on ‘GitHub’

{covr2gh} provides an automated way to summarise the impact of a pull
request (PR) on test coverage directly within GitHub.

It is designed to be used with GitHub Actions: once configured, coverage
insight is posted as a comment on the pull request.

The goal is to make test coverage feedback visible, concise, and
actionable, without requiring reviewers to leave GitHub or inspect full
coverage reports.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {covr2gh} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

## Usage

{covr2gh} includes a helper function that adds a GitHub Actions workflow
to your package. This workflow calculates coverage and posts feedback
when pull requests are opened or updated.

``` r
covr2gh::use_covr2gh_action()
```

The helper function also adds a badge to your README, in the {usethis}
badge “block”, if present.

``` md
<!-- badges: start -->
![covr2gh-badge](...)
<!-- badges: end -->
```

After this initial setup step, no further manual interaction with the
package is typically required. Coverage comments are generated
automatically whenever the workflow is triggered on GitHub.
